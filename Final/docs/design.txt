The purpose of this program is to organize Division III Women's volleyball teams and allow the user 
to access and update information about the various teams and their players. It is a dynamic program 
incorporating multiple files and a database that can be expanded upon to include more teams and 
players and track information related to them. The ability to pull this information from the database allows 
us to perform calculations on player statistics and could be used to guide decisions on team lineups and 
related decisions.
